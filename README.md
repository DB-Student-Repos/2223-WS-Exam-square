# Square the Number
A friend of yours with a strong visual sense asks you to square a few numbers for him. Being proficient with some basics in programming you wholeheartedly agreed. You didn't imagine these exact expectations though.
Squaring for your friend meant putting each digit of the number into a different segment of a matrix. So,

123456789

would become a square grid:

1 2 34 5 67 8 9

Thank god, your friend isn't very particular about maths. So,

1234567891

would also become the same grid:

1 2 34 5 67 8 9

Can you help your friend create such a grid for each number not smaller than 1000?

HINT: Use the isqrt-function as part of your solution. It is already imported :-)
